# Short Google Vision Accuracy Test

A web app that lets users go through a dataset generated by google vision's photo tagging api and assess accuracy.

## Features

**Current Capabilities:**
* Allows the user to view photos in the dataset one at a time and decide if the given tag is correct or not.
* Multiple users can use the website at any time, as long as one dataset at a time is being assessed.
* All user-generated data persists.

**The user flow:**

When users first look at the web page they will see a call to action to begin assessment. They then view photos and their generated tags one at a time, and choose if the tag is correct or not. When users have assessed all of the photos in the dataset they are taken to a page which graphs the results.
